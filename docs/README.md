This is an effort to get the [mwf-designer](https://github.com/mono/mwf-designer) work again.

**Current Status**

The fork has removed Mono.Design to compile again.

=== Linux ===

make && make run

=== On Microsoft .NET with Visual Studio ===

Open mwf-designer.sln with Visual Studio and you are done!
