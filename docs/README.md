easysimplified-designer is an effort to get the [mwf-designer](https://github.com/mono/mwf-designer) work again.

#### Current Status

The fork has removed Mono.Design to compile again.

#### Building from Source
=== Linux ===

make && make run

=== On Microsoft .NET with Visual Studio ===

Open mwf-designer.sln with Visual Studio and you are done!

#### Also note:
This repositority used ICSharpCode.NRefactory.dll under deps since its beginning.
Source code for this old librarie version I think can be found in SharpDevelop here https://github.com/MakiWolf/SharpDevelop/tree/2.2.1/src/Libraries/NRefactory/Project/Src
